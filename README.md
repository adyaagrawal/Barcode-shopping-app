# Barcode-shopping-app
The app scans the barcodes of the products and adds them to a virtual shopping cart. 
Aim is to eliminate the long wait at the checkout counters where people lose valuable time. 
Customers can scan the barcodes, set quantity or simply remove items from the list.
A total payable amount appears at the bottom which the user then pays, making checkouts fast and convenient.
